# KdegaScormEngine
SCORM is a set of technical standards for eLearning products. It provides the communication method and data models that allow eLearning content and LMSs to work together. 
It tells programmers how to write code so that what they build will “play well” with other eLearning software. SCORM is the most widely used eLearning standard available.

### What KdegaScormEngine?
Is the fully RTE using C#, ASP.NET 8, and Razor package for doing all the SCORM packages running hassle. It is a Self-host Service, you call it from anywhere even if you have a system just download, restore, and Run. So you can upload the SCORM zip package using the REST API endpoint, and add Scorm packages to the learner, Paring Manifest, after that you can call the player from your System as well, or may use the player as self as a razor page.
The KdegaScormEngine is a SCORM Run-Time specification that controls how the LMS launches content and how the content then communicates with the LMS. All of this communication happens within the context of a single attempt on a single SCO. The navigation between SCOs is governed by the sequencing specified in the manifest and explained further
